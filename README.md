# Simulate Secure Sandbox

## Overview

Simulate Secure Sandbox is an interactive learning and experimentation environment focused on understanding, reproducing, and fixing real-world software vulnerabilities. The project leverages the recent SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors to highlight the most prevalent and critical code weaknesses in modern applications.

This repository is designed for developers, security enthusiasts, and engineers who want to:

- Explore common vulnerabilities hands-on.

- Learn how to reproduce and troubleshoot insecure code.

- Practice patching and validating fixes using secure CI/CD workflows.

## Features

- Vulnerability Scenarios: Interactive examples based on the SANS Top 25, covering code issues such as injection flaws, improper authorization, and buffer errors.

- Fix & Validation Workflow: Apply patches and verify fixes using automated testing, security checks, and CI/CD pipelines.

- Security Tooling: Integrates lightweight, containerized scanning tools such as OWASP ZAP, fuzzers, and Burp Suite for dynamic application testing.

Hands-On Learning: Encourages experimentation in a safe, isolated environment to deepen understanding of secure coding principles.

## Goals

- Enable practical, hands-on exploration of software vulnerabilities.

- Promote secure coding practices and remediation workflows.

- Provide a sandboxed lab for testing, scanning, and validating security fixes.
